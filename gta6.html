        <p>
          Grand Theft Auto 6 has been in development for nine years, almost ten.
          Grand Theft Auto 6 has become a sort of a running joke within the
          gaming community because it has taken so long to come out. Right now
          it's scheduled to be released in fall 2025. Rockstar Games is known
          for delays in their video game releases, so most places are saying
          they could be delayed 2026 that would make it 13 years in between the
          two games.
        </p>

        <p>
          Grand Theft Auto 5 is the latest released edition of this game that
          came out in September 2013 and is beginning to show how outdated it
          is. Grand Theft Auto 5 taking place in Los Santos based off of Los
          Angeles California. The Issue in Grand Theft Auto 5 is it's easy to
          cheat and has a lot of bugs no matter what system you are on. As of
          now, it's been 11 years without fixes to cheaters and bugs, just
          cosmetic updates.
        </p>

        <p>
          The upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled for release in the fall
          of 2025 for consoles. The current trailer shows it to be set in Vice
          City based in Florida according to Acer Corner “The Grand Theft Auto 5
          map spans 29.28 square miles (75.84 square kilometers), while the new
          map could reach around 48.26 square miles (125 square kilometers)”
          (“Bigger, Better, Badder: How the Grand Theft Auto 6 Map Might
          Redefine GTA History”). There is one main protagonist, maybe two, the
          main protagonist named Lucia and the possible other main character
          being called Jason.

        <p>
          Rockstar has been working on Grand Theft Auto 6 since 2014. A hacker
          named Arion Kurtaj leaked 90 clips of the unreleased and hugely
          anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 using just an Amazon Firestick, mobile
          phone, and hotel TV in 2022. Some people think Grand Theft Auto 6 has
          been delayed because of Red Dead Redemption 2 which started being
          worked on shortly following the release of the original Red Dead
          Redemption being released in 2010. This and Grand Theft Auto 5 are
          being updated consistently with cosmetic and events delayed Grand
          Theft Auto 6.

        <p>
          In conclusion, the gaming world is excited, overall, about the
          upcoming release of the game in 2025. Reviews of the game-released
          trailers have been mainly positive. The new version of Grand Theft
          Auto 6 has been coming into the gaming world for a long time after 12
          years of waiting. Let’s hope that the latest version of the game is
          worth the wait.
